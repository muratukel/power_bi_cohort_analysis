# Let's Learn How to Create Cohort Analysis Using Power BI ðŸ“Š

### What is Cohort Analysis?

Cohort analysis is a subset of behavioral analytics that takes the data from a given eCommerce platform, web application, or online game and rather than looking at all users as one unit, it breaks them into related groups for analysis. These related groups, or cohorts, usually share common characteristics or experiences within a defined time-span.

Cohort analysis is a tool to measure user engagement over time. It helps to know whether user engagement is actually getting better over time or is only appearing to improve because of growth.

Cohort analysis proves to be valuable because it helps to separate growth metrics from engagement metrics as growth can easily mask engagement problems. In reality, the lack of activity of the old users is being hidden by the impressive growth numbers of new users, which results in concealing the lack of engagement from a small number of people.

I can convey it to you better with this visual:

In this chart, we are looking at the retained count of customers who signed up for an e-commerce website over a 24-month period. The chart is divided into groups based on the month in which the customers signed up. Each row represents a different group, and each column represents a different month.

The numbers in the chart represent the count of customers who are still active (i.e., not churned) from each group for each month. For example, in the first row (the group of customers who signed up in December), 985 customers were active in the first month, but by the 12th month, only 359 customers were still active.
