# Let's Learn How to Create Cohort Analysis Using Power BI üìä

### What is Cohort Analysis?

‚òëÔ∏è Cohort analysis is a subset of behavioral analytics that takes the data from a given eCommerce platform, web application, or online game and rather than looking at all users as one unit, it breaks them into related groups for analysis. These related groups, or cohorts, usually share common characteristics or experiences within a defined time-span.

‚òëÔ∏è Cohort analysis is a tool to measure user engagement over time. It helps to know whether user engagement is actually getting better over time or is only appearing to improve because of growth.

‚òëÔ∏è Cohort analysis proves to be valuable because it helps to separate growth metrics from engagement metrics as growth can easily mask engagement problems. In reality, the lack of activity of the old users is being hidden by the impressive growth numbers of new users, which results in concealing the lack of engagement from a small number of people.

I can convey it to you better with this visual:

‚òëÔ∏è In this chart, we are looking at the retained count of customers who signed up for an e-commerce website over a 24-month period. The chart is divided into groups based on the month in which the customers signed up. Each row represents a different group, and each column represents a different month.

‚òëÔ∏è The numbers in the chart represent the count of customers who are still active (i.e., not churned) from each group for each month. For example, in the first row (the group of customers who signed up in December), 985 customers were active in the first month, but by the 12th month, only 359 customers were still active.

‚òëÔ∏è By looking at this chart, we can see that retention rates tend to decrease over time for all cohorts, but some cohorts may have higher retention rates than others. This information can help us identify which groups are the most valuable and which may require more attention to improve retention rates.

‚òëÔ∏è As we read down the columns, things start to get more interesting, and potentially more complicated. But bear with us. In the chart below, there is a big drop in numbers for most months between columns three and four, noticeable by the sudden change in shading between those columns: darker to lighter.

‚òëÔ∏è What we can take from this is that the critical time for customer retention is three months after the first purchase. Armed with this knowledge, the eCommerce business can now start to address why this is happening and start rolling out new measures to halt the trend. For instance, it might develop a loyalty campaign around the three-month mark to draw customers back in and ward off the march towards ever-fading attention. Adding seasonal campaigns can also increase the number of active customers by attracting their attention.
